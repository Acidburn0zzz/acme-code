Gnome Shell 3.16 removed the ability to set a busy status for
notifications.

This extension only sets status for notifications. It does
integrate setting of presence with Online Accounts.

The issue is discussed on the Fedora Desktop List:
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/desktop/2015-June/012417.html

Panel button toggles presense status {BUSY | AVAILABLE}.
